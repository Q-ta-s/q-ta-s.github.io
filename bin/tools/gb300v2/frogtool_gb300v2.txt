The usage is the same as the method described in frogtool for GB300(V1) below:
https://github.com/RednibCoding/frogtool

------------------------------------------
- Windows executable (.exe)
Either

・Double click from Windows Explorer, it will ask you to enter the drive and system and then proceed
・Or run it on the command line as follows:

frogtool [drive] [system] [platform] [-sc]

Example: frogtool H: FC GB300

On other platforms you may run it through WINE although this has not been tested.

- Python script (.py)

You will need to have a Python interpreter installed, this was developed against version 3.10 & should at least work with this and later versions.
In order to use the thumbnail generation functionality you will additionally need to have Pillow installed.
Then either

・If you have .py files associated with your interpreter, you can double click and run it
・Otherwise, run it on the command line as follows:

python frogtool.py [drive] [system] [platform] [-sc]

Example: python frogtool.py H: FC GB300

(the "python" command depends on your setup, you may need to use "py" or "python3")
